    - It is not possible to access an external server from within a smart contract. 
    - Thus, it is not possible for the EVM to directly notify external applications 
      about the occurrence of some event.

    - Thatâ€™s why there are events in Solidity. 
    - It is information issued within contracts and has two purposes: recording such data in a log form, 
      and indirectly warning about the occurrence of events on the blockchain. 
    - This can be done because external applications can monitor the emission of events, 
      and thus react to changes in the state of the blockchain.


    - One of the uses of events is to log data into the blockchain, at a much lower cost than using the storage.
    - Currently, the price of changing a variable in storage from zero to non-zero is 20,000 units of gas. 
    - As a comparison, each recorded log costs 375 units of gas, plus 375 units for each indexed topic, 
      plus a lower value for non-indexed parameters (8 units per byte).

    - Anonymous events are declared with the anonymous modifier, 
      which must be placed after the parameter declaration. 

    - Anonymous events, in addition to allowing the use of 4 indexed parameters, 
    also allows recording logs without any indexed parameters. 
    - This is the cheapest way to record information on the blockchain for external access.
